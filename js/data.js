        Application:
        A colloid mill is a machine that is used to reduce the particle size of a solid in suspension in a liquid, 
        or to reduce the droplet size of a liquid suspended in another liquid. This is done by applying high 
        levels of hydraulic shear to the process liquid. It is frequently used to increase the stability of 
        suspensions and emulsions. The colloid mill is used for various applications such as Superfine 
        grinding, homogenizing, emulsifying, dispersing, mixing and extracting of liquids, ointments and 
        highly viscous products in pharmaceutical, cosmetics, suspensions & emulsion industry.

        "images": ["./assets/img/hero-banner.jpg"],
        "details":`
        The filter press is a solid liquid separation device using the principle of pressure feeding. It is highly 
        efficient, compact, dewatering device for separating solids from liquid slurries in the form of 
        compressed cake. It has wide range of applications by several industries like Pharma, bulk drugs, 
        distilleries, beverages & other industries. 
        The unfiltered liquid is fed into the filter under positive pressure, where liquid travels in downwards 
        direction and finds its way through opening on sides of the Filter Plates. As the liquid pressure 
        increases, the Filter media holds the foreign particles and allows only clear filtrate to pass through 
        the central channel formed by interlocking pressure cups to the outlet. Filtration is continued until 
        the cake holding capacity of the unit is reached or until the filtrate rate becomes too slow owing to 
        cake resistance.
        Salient Features:
         Design is cGMP with all contact parts AISI 316L
         Complete filtration of the batch without any hold up due to reverse flow of liquid.
         The cake, filtered & solids remain totally enclosed allowing filtration of toxic, hazardous & explosive 
        liquids.
         No contamination of internal surface of shell.
         The top dome structure ensures fast & easy removal of cartridge assembly & cleaning of cake.

        "images": ["./assets/img/hero-banner.jpg"],
        "details":`
        Application:
        The homogenizer is often necessary to mix one or more substances within a liquid. This device 
        allows to micronize and scatters the particles suspended in the fluid, so that the product become 
        highly stable, no matter the followings treatments and stockings the products may undergo. The 
        homogenizer delivers unparalleled consistency and control of high shear process applications such 
        as, Immiscible Phase Emulsifying, Homogenizing, Wet Grinding, Texturing, De agglomeration and 
        Fine Dispersing. 
        The product arrives to the homogenizing at a low speed and at high pressure (cause by the little gape 
        between the passing head and collision head). During the passage the product is subjected to 
        numerous forces which cause the particles micronization: a violent acceleration followed by an 
        immediate deceleration that produces cavitations and then the globules explosion. Strong turbulence 
        united to high frequency vibrations. Collision cutting strengths derived from the laminar passage 
        between the homogenizing valve surfaces and the following impact with the collision ring.
        Incorporating up to single sets of toothed rotor-stator heads, engineered to extremely fine radial 
        tolerances, the Emulsifier processes product at high differential velocities, as many as 18 times in a 
        single-pass. The result is consistent, repeatable quality at capacities exceeding those of conventional 
        multiple-pass technology, such as in-tank high-shear mixers, colloid mills and shear pumps.
        Salient Features:
         Design is cGMP with all contact parts AISI 316.
         Capacity up to 5,
        000 liters.
         Single-pass processing results in reduced batch times by up to 80% and repeatability batch-afterbatch 
         Energy savings when compared with in-tank mixers, colloid mills and homogenizers.
